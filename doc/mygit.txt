Git Flow Workflow~

First things first, you need to install git-flow: >
	apt-get install git-flow
<
Then initialize git-flow in an existing repository. You'll have to
answer some question regarding your naming conventions, but it is
recommanded to use the default values. >
	git flow init
<
Start develop a new feature from the 'develop' branch: >
	git flow feature start MYFEATURE
<
If you ware developing a feature in collaboration, publish the feature to
the remote server: >
	git flow feature publish MYFEATURE
<
To get the feature published by another user: >
	git flow feature pull origin MYFEATURE
<
You an track a feature on origin by using: >
	git flow feature track MYFEATURE
<
Finish a feature, merge the feature into 'develop' branch, remove
the feature branch and switch back to 'develop': >
	git flow feature finish MYFEATURE
<
